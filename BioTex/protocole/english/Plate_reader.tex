\subsection{Measure fluorescence with TECAN plate reader}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wrap all plates with aluminum
\item Start the plate reader and choose "DexFITC" method
\item Verify that all wells are selected 
\item Verify that exitation wave lenght is set at  485 nm and emission at 535 nm
\item Verify that gain is set to 50 (you can adjust it if needed when some well are saturated, \textbf{BUT YOU SHOULD PERFORM ALL THE MEASURES WITH THE SAME GAIN !})
\item Read the fluorescence for each plate
\item Save all results in a excel spreadsheet where the file title should contain relevant information on the experiment
\item Save this file under : \\ Desktop/LabRoullin/Florian/DATE\_usefull\_informations/Date\_usefull\_informations.xlsx
\item Take an USB key or send the results in email
\end{enumerate}
