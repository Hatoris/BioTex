\subsection{TEER mesurement}
\label{TEER}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add 1 $mL$ of medium in the Endohm-6 cup
\item Take the plate from the incubator
\item Wait at least 15 min 
\item Wire the two cables on the  Endohm-6 cup and one on the apparatus 
\item On the apparatus and verify that 2000 $\Omega$ is selected
\item Take the insert and add it in the Endohm-6 cup
\item Measure the resistance in each well 
\item Note values on the hood glass, when all mesure are done take a pictures of it
\item Report values on a excel spreadsheet
\end{enumerate}
